- Ensure good lighting (for screen capture)

## Embedding in Documentation

### Markdown (GitHub)
```markdown
![Page Flip Animation](animation-demo.gif)
```

### HTML
```html
<video width="400" controls>
  <source src="page-flip-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

### Animated GIF
```markdown
![Animated Page Flip](page-flip.gif)
```

## Sample Frame Captures

If you can't record video, take screenshots at key moments:

1. **page1-initial.png** - Starting position
2. **page-flip-25.png** - 25% through animation
3. **page-flip-50.png** - Mid-flip (maximum rotation)
4. **page-flip-75.png** - 75% through animation
5. **page2-final.png** - Final position

Then create a composite image showing all frames.

## Conclusion

Recording the page flip animation helps demonstrate the polished, 
professional quality of the Book Reader app. The 3D effect creates 
an immersive reading experience that sets this app apart from basic 
document viewers.

Share your recording to show off the beautiful animation!

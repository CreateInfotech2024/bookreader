## Technical Changes

### Dependencies:
```yaml
# BEFORE
dependencies:
  docx_to_text: ^1.0.1      # Text extraction only
  video_player: ^2.10.0      # Unused
  syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer: ^27.1.48  # Present but unused

# AFTER
dependencies:
  syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer: ^27.1.48  # Now used!
  # Removed: docx_to_text, video_player
```

### Main Implementation:
```dart
// BEFORE - Complex text processing
Future<void> _loadDocumentFromAssets() async {
  final ByteData data = await rootBundle.load(assetDocxPath);
  final Uint8List bytes = data.buffer.asUint8List();
  final text = await docxToText(bytes);  // Loses everything!
  List<BookPage> newPages = _splitTextIntoPages(text);
  // ... hundreds of lines of parsing
}

// AFTER - Simple PDF viewing
SfPdfViewer.asset(
  assetPdfPath,
  controller: _pdfViewerController,
  enableTextSelection: true,
  canShowScrollHead: true,
  canShowScrollStatus: true,
)
```

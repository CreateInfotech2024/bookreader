## Known Limitations

### Current Version
1. **Tables**: Not yet implemented (can be added)
2. **Lists**: Numbered/bulleted lists not yet parsed
3. **Images**: Extracted but not yet displayed in UI (ready to implement)
4. **Complex Layouts**: Some advanced DOCX features not supported

### Not Limitations (By Design)
- Single scrollable page (better UX than pagination)
- Simple search (sufficient for most use cases)
- Transform-based zoom (standard Flutter approach)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Can Be Added Later
- [ ] Display extracted images with Image.memory()
- [ ] Table rendering (`<w:tbl>` parsing)
- [ ] List support (numbered/bulleted)
- [ ] Header and footer rendering
- [ ] Footnotes and endnotes
- [ ] Hyperlink support
- [ ] Export to PDF
- [ ] Multiple document support
- [ ] Advanced search with highlighting

## Migration Guide

### For Users with PDF Files

**Option 1: Online Conversion**
- Adobe: https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/pdf-to-word.html
- iLovePDF: https://www.ilovepdf.com/pdf_to_word

**Option 2: Desktop Software**
- Microsoft Word: Open PDF → Save As → DOCX
- LibreOffice: Open PDF → Export → Word Document

**Option 3: Command Line**
```bash
libreoffice --headless --convert-to docx input.pdf
```

### Reverting to PDF (If Needed)
1. Restore `syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer` in pubspec.yaml
2. Checkout previous lib/main.dart: `git checkout 0e4ff7c lib/main.dart`
3. Update asset path to `.pdf` file

---

## Performance Analysis

### Load Time
- **DOCX Extraction**: ~1-2 seconds for typical document
- **XML Parsing**: Fast with xml package
- **HTML Rendering**: Efficient with flutter_widget_from_html

### Memory Usage
- **Images**: Stored as Uint8List (efficient)
- **HTML Content**: Single string (minimal overhead)
- **UI**: Standard Flutter widgets (optimized)

### User Experience
- **Smooth Scrolling**: SingleChildScrollView
- **Responsive Zoom**: Transform.scale
- **Fast Search**: String-based matching

---

## Dependencies Added

```yaml
flutter_widget_from_html: ^0.14.11  # 🎨 HTML rendering
archive: ^3.4.0                      # 📦 ZIP extraction
xml: ^6.3.0                          # 📄 XML parsing
flutter_inappwebview: ^6.0.0        # 🌐 WebView support
path_provider: ^2.1.1                # 📁 File system
```

**Total Size Impact**: ~2-3 MB (reasonable for functionality gained)
